# Tips

1.  Put the "npm install" command on your first slide and lead off by instructing
    attendees to start their download.
    
2.  Make your font big.  The slide frameworks tend to make text (and especially
    code) waaaaay too small.
    
3.  An interesting idea to try:  Guide the group through the first step of the
    workshopper to help people get started.
